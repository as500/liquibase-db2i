# Liquibase Db2 for i Extension

This extension allows you to use Liquibase with Db2 for i on the IBM i.  [IBM i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_i).

That's the platform formerly known as i5, iSeries, and AS/400.   

And cheekily referred to by some few of us as as500. (Because let's face it, Db2 for i on IBM i doesn't exactly roll off the tongue).

## Download

Download the liquibase-db2i-1.0.jar file form the [release page](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-db2i/releases)
